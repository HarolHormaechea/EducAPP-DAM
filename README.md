Final project for C.F.G.S: Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma (Vocational Degree), as presented on May 2016.

The project full scope was never completed, and the UI was extremely simple due to time constraints (the final project for the course had, technically speaking, 30 work-hours assigned as stated in the degree syllabus).

Can be useful as a template to configure a Spring Boot application for REST work in combination with a MySQL database.
